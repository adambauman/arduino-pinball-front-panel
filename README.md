### BauTek Mini Pinball Front Panel Control ###
(March 2016)

This code runs the microcontroller that handles all of the front panel button pushes and LEDs. The front panel includes two LEDS for the coin slots, four main face buttons for volume control and table selection as well a hidden button that can be used for utility functions in the future. The front panel also contains a LIS3DH 3-axis accelerometer for tilt control (coming in the future once I figure out the acceleration math.)

Parts list and circuit layout coming soon!
